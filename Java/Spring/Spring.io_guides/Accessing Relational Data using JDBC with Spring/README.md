# Accessing Relational Data using JDBC with Spring #

@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

* @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
* @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
* @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the hello package. In this case, there arenâ€™t any.
